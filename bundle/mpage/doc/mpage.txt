2. MultiPager Manual					*mpage-manual* {{{1

							*:MPage*
  The purpose of MultiPager is to provide multiple views of a buffer, with
  each sequential window showing sequential lines of text, rather like
  a book.  One may invoke the MPage viewing with either >

	:MPage [splits]
	:[splits]MPage
<
  The "splits" parameter tells MultiPager to split the window into that
  many subwindows.  If "splits" is 1, then the window joins those windows
  that are under MultiPage control.  Without the [splits] option, a >

  	:MPage
<
  command will turn multipaging off in all the windows holding the current
  buffer in the tab.  Note that this does not "quit" those windows; they are
  simply no longer multi-page synchronized.

  A trailing exclamation point, >

  	:MPage!
<
  will turn multipaging off in all windows in the current tab.  If you've only
  done multipaging for one buffer, then :MPage and MPage! will have the same
  effect.

  The command >

	:MPT
<
  command will toggle just the current window's participation in multi-paging.
  Multipage, however, defines several maps; user settings will not be restored
  until no more windows displaying the buffer are under MultiPage control.

  As an example, ctrl-f is mapped by MultiPager to do a full page scroll on
  MultiPage-controlled windows, not a full page less two lines as is
  customary.

					*:MPN* *:MPP*
  To advance to the next mpage-controlled window, or to go back to the
  previous mpage-controlled window, use >

  	:MPN
	:MPP
<
  respectively.  These commands also accept counts; as in >

  	:MPN 2
	:2MPP
<
  These two commands are also optionally followed by a "bang": >

  	:MPN!
	:MPN! 2
<

   Without the bang, wrapping is permitted; with the bang, wrapping from the
   first/last window (:MPP and :MPN, respectively) is not permitted.

					*:mpage-pageup*  *:mpage-pagedown*
  MPage provides the following two maps: >

	<PageDown> scroll multi-paging windows forward
	<PageUp>   scroll multi-paging windows backward
<
  by the number of lines displayed in all the windows under multi-paging
  control.  If one had three windows displaying a buffer under MultiPager
  control, a <PageDown> would scroll to the next three pages (irrespective
  of within which of the three pages the <PageDown> command was issued).

  OPTIONS:

  *g:mpage_autonxtwin* if this variable exists (not the default), then
                     when in insert mode and the line number advances
		     past the end of a mpage-controlled window, then
		     the cursor will be placed at the top of the next
		     mpage controlled window.

3. MultiPager History					*mpage-history* {{{1
   v1	Feb 24, 2009	* in visual mode, RestoreWinPosn causes problems.
   			  Bypassed by returning early from ReSync().
	May 04, 2009	* :MPage turns off resync for all windows in a tab
			* :MPage splits  keeps first window as it was,
			  instead of moving it to the last MPage'd window
	May 20, 2009	* cecutil bugfix
	May 21, 2009	* Using SaveUserMaps()-RestoreUserMaps() to do a
			  s:ReSync() call when using ctrl-y or ctrl-e
	Jun 22, 2009    * Added :MPage! support for toggling a window's
			  participation in MPage synchronization.
	May 03, 2010	* removed <c-o>s from maps
	Nov 05, 2010	* added V and v to list of modes that causes s:ReSync()
			  to skip re-synchronization.  Removed m and M; I'm not
			  sure why they were there.
	Jun 01, 2011	* mpage will synchronize in insert mode when the line
			  number changes.
			* when mpage is active, windows are |'nospr'| and |'nosb'|.
			* |g:mpage_autonxtwin| implemented
	Nov 02, 2012	* protected all |:windo| calls by preceding them with
			  |:noautocmd|
	Jan 14, 2013	* ctrl-f and ctrl-b now move up and down exactly one
			  full page (for MPage windows)
	Jan 15, 2013	* |:MPT| introduced; :MPage! and :MPage (with no
			  splits specified) have been changed.  All maps are
			  now buffer local.
	Apr 24, 2013	* (David Kotchan) provided a patch permitting MPage
			  to work with a non-zero |'scrolloff'|
			  (version 1 released)
